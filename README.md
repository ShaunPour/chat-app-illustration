- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was honestly one of the more complicated css projects that I've done so far. Generally when a project assigns me to build a preview for a mobile application, I just use a picture of the app and design the rest of the page while resizing
the app photo. Having to design the formatting of the app and build it myself using a div as the phone and subdivs to contain the pieces and create the phone lip as part of the preview was a great challenge. It also gave me the chance to
play around with css animation a little bit to make the chat bubbles animate in when the page loaded. Ideally, I would like to stagger the loads so the bubbles animate in one at a time but I would probably need javascript for that.
